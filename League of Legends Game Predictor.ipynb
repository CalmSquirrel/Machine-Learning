    "This project is to predict who would win in a professional game of League of Legends depending on the first fifteen minutes of a game. League of Legends is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) where five players play against 5 other players. Each player chooses one of 139 champions. The map is split into three lanes that are named based on their location: top, mid, bot. The area between the lanes is considered the jungle. Gold is acquired through multiple ways throughout the game and is used to buy items that usually helps with dealing damage to other players. To win the game, one team must defeat the nexus in the other team's base. In order to get to the nexus, all turrets and inhibitors must be destroyed in one lane. In the jungle there are objectives, like dragons, barons, and rift herald, that you can take to boost team stats for either a permanent or temporary advantage. A couple different approaches were taken to see if there was an optimal way to process the data."

    "Each classification method produces very similar accuracies. The lowest accuracy we get is around 75%. The highest accruacy that was obtained was 85%. This is to be expected since there are many games where the team with a lead isn't able to press their advantage into a victory. There is also the problem where the team with the early disadvantage performs better later in the game due to late game advantages, better teamwork, better shotcalling, team composition etc. Because of the reasons listed, a 75-85% accuracy is pretty decent because humans are playing the game, not robots that would make perfect decisions throughout the game. Of all the approaches taken with this project, none of them seemed to be better than the others."
